# PresqueYaml

In French, "presque" means "almost". If you understand it right, `PresqueYaml` is a yaml subset serialization library üòÉ.

<table><tr><td>If you want a strict 1.2 yaml parser, do not use this project: missing features will probably never be implemented.</td></tr></table>

`PresqueYaml` is written in F# and offers:
* Yaml deserialization to a representation model (AST)
* Map representation model to an object model
* C# support: List<>, Dictionary<,>, Nullable<> and POCO
* F# support: list, map, option, unit and record

Again, `PresqueYaml` does not offer complete yaml support and uses some non-standard behavior.

Here are some key differences:
* scalar are always literal (\n between items) - never folded (concatenated with space). If you want spaces, use single line form.
* multi-lines scalar must be indented relative to start of first item.
* inline sequences do not support quoted strings. Use standard sequence if you need to.
* quoted strings are either single or double quoted strings - they are the same. Only newlines are escaped.
* compact form (both sequence and mapping) can be nested at will on same line.
* mapping can have duplicated keys (last key wins).
* empty document is a valid document.
* no support for multiple document in one yaml file.

All in all, `PresqueYaml` does support this kind of document (‚èé to highlight spaces in document):
```yaml
‚èé
#     user 1‚èé

      ‚èé

Corresponding AST is:
