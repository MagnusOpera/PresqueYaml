# PresqueYaml

In French, "presque" means "almost". If you understand it right, `PresqueYaml` is a yaml subset serialization library üòÉ.

<table><tr><td>If you want a strict 1.2 yaml parser, do not use this project: missing features will probably never be implemented.</td></tr></table>

`PresqueYaml` is written in F# and offers:
* Yaml deserialization to a representation model (AST).
* Map representation model to an object model.
* C# support: List<>, Dictionary<,>, Nullable<> and POCO (via unique constructor).
* F# support: list, map, option, unit and record.

Again, `PresqueYaml` does not offer complete yaml support.

Here are some key differences:
* quoted strings are either single or double quoted strings - they are the same.
* quoted string keys are not allowed.
* mapping can have duplicated keys (last key wins).
* no support for multiple document in one yaml file.
* no schema support.

All in all, `PresqueYaml` does support this kind of document (‚èé to highlight spaces in document):
```yaml
‚èé
#     user 1‚èé
user1:‚èé
      ‚èé
  name: John Doe‚èé
‚èé

‚èé
   # this is a comment‚èé

  - banana: yellow‚èé

```

Corresponding AST is:
```ocaml
